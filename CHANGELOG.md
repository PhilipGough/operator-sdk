## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `operator-sdk up` command to help deploy an operator. Currently supports running an operator locally against an existing cluster e.g `operator-sdk up local --kubeconfig=<path-to-kubeconfig>`. See `operator-sdk up -h` for help. [#219](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/219)

### Changed

- All the modules in [`pkg/sdk`](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/tree/master/pkg/sdk) have been combined into a single package. `action`, `handler`, `informer` `types` and `query` pkgs have been consolidated into `pkg/sdk`.
